# This uploads sensor to the IBM Cloudant NoSQL database. This is designed to run in a Arduino YUN compatible device.
# Because of the size, complexity, and dependencies of python packages we will use custom singular purpose code.
# Runs lean and mean for Arduino YUN OpenWrt OS. I personally use the MediaTek LinKit Smart 7688 Duo.

# HTTPS certificate validation is disabled. Last thing we need is HTTPS certificate issues we cant fix
# on remote embedded devices
